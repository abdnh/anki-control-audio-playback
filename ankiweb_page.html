This adds options to control audio playback speed in the reviewer.
You can configure the shortcuts and the speed change from the add-on config under <b>Tools > Add-ons</b>.

There are several add-ons on AnkiWeb that do the same, but it appears that none of them works on the latest versions of Anki (2.1.49+).

This only works with the mpv media player (which Anki uses by default on all platforms).
