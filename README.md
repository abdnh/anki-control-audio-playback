Anki add-on that adds options to control audio playback speed in the reviewer.

You can configure the shortcuts and the speed change from the add-on config under **Tools > Add-ons**.

There are several add-ons on AnkiWeb that do the same, but it appears that none of them works on the latest versions of Anki (2.1.49+).

This only works with the mpv media player (which Anki uses by default on all platforms).

You can download the add-on from its AnkiWeb page: https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/312734862
